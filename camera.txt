Raspberry Pi Camera Set up

 
    To view the camera remotely, it is necessary to install the
RPI-Cam-Web-Interface. This is a low latency platform that will 
allow the viewing and recording of the pi camera. Instructions for set up
can be found here:  https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface, and a 
quick review can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTZMOHE8v-Q. 

    Once installed. the camera can be viewed at http://<ipaddress>/html. Settings 
for resolution, rotation ect will be availible. We need to rotate our camera
270 degrees for an upright view.

    Initially, I wanted to use the raspberry Pi camera module; however,
viewing the camera over a VNC viewer was not possible. This is a fast and
effective method for viewing the robot's camera.  If we would like to use any
of the camera's data for computer vision, we will need to use the pi's
camera module. This should be fairly straightforward to impliment later.
