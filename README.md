Course: Columbia University, Robotics Studio <br>
Robot Name: Ghost <br>
Keywords: Robot, Locomotion, Reinforcement Learning, Parametric Optimization, Bullet Simulation 

## Description
This repository hosts files to run a simulation of our designed quadruped robot in a Pybullet Simulation. The robot was designed in solidworks, detailed in a URDF file, and imported into the bullet simulation. The python files in this repository are used to run numerous simulations on the robot, training it to walk efficiently. Parametric optimization and reinforcemnent learning techniques will be used to optimize the robot's gait, and improve stability and speed. 

## Files included
* Ghost folder
  + This directory includes the stl files, and urdf representation of Ghost
* Sim.py
  + This file runs the most up to date version of our simulation. 
  
  
## Next Steps
We still plan to build our designed robot; however, this has been put on hold due to the current global climate. We look forward to regaining access to the Columbia University Makerspace and Machine Shop.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Dr. Hod Lipson for his guidance with the design and simulation of our robot. We also extend credit to all other students in our course, as the course's studio nature allows for many recomendations and tips accross the many teams.
